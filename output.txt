welcome back aliens my name is Naveenready and finally we are starting with aseries on Python or Python it doesn'tmatter how you pronounce itwhat matters is it is one of thefastest-growing language in what termsin terms of number of developers who areusing it in terms of the number oflibraries we have in terms of number ofcompanies who are using it and in termsof the areas you can implement it youtalk about machine learning you talkabout GUI software development webdevelopment you can use it everywhereand that's why it is also called as ageneral-purpose language so in thisvideo we will talk about what is Pythonand why it is so useful and why youshould learn it so what is Python as Imentioned python is a programminglanguage of course but it is alsointerpreted object-oriented andhigh-level language now does it meansyou cannot do procedures here you can itit also supports procedural readprogramming as well as object-orientedit depend upon your purpose right youcan use it the way you want but whymethods of famers we have C C++ JavaJavaScript and still pythons famous nowsome people say that pythons a newlanguage and not exactly Java came intopicture in 1995 and Python came in 1989so it's way before Java right now sowhen Java came into picture theenterprise market you know the everyonestarted using Java but then I thinkpython was there you know it was therefor other people to use example let'ssay if you want to learn a language forthe first time Putnam was there but nowsince the advancement of machinelearning AI this is a field where wehave research scientists they don't wantto spend much time on learningprogramming language so what they dothey they wait for the easiest languageavailable and the easiest languageavailable in the market is Python andyes python is damn easy it is muchsimpler than C C++ and Java that's whymost of the colleges and schools theyare teaching Pythonyou might be thinking which company usesPython now it just leaves those smallsmall companies who uses Python we haveGoogle we have YouTube we have Dropboxso we can see we have all thesecompanies who are using Python as a mainlanguage or as a support languageexample let's say Google has so manyfeatures somethose features is coding ADA in Pythonnot in the same way we have this one ofthe big website called as reddit redditis today return in Python now let'sfocus on this name Python in fact whenyou talk about C C++ Java this namesthey have some story rightwhat about Python is just because thislanguage looks like a snakenot exactly the author of Python he's abig fan of a British comedy movie calledas Monty Python's Flying Circus andthat's why he went with a name called asPython initially and then when everyonewanted everyone liked it he went for thesame name now can they learn Python andthe answer is yes it is one of theeasiest language to learn and even ifyou are from a non-technical backgroundyou have not written any code you canstart with Python what if I say Pythoncame into picture just to help thosepeople who don't know how to read a codein fact children can learn Python isthat easynow Python has multiple versions we haveone point X we have two point X and wehave three point X and of course weshould be learning three point X rightthat means two point X is not in therein the market and the answer is no themark the two point X is still in themarket because when three point X cameinto picture it was very different fromtwo point X normally what happens inprogramming language you know when Javaeight came into picture so it wasbackward compatible with Java 1.7 whenjawan 1.7 came into picture it wasbackward compatible with 1.6 but that'snot the case with Python you know thetwo different versions has two differenta way of working and that's why we havetwo point X still running in the marketand it does have a support till 2020 sowhich one you should learn of coursethree point X right because it is newand there will be lot of features whichyou can work on so that's theintroduction from this video in the nextvideo we'll talk about how to installPython how to work with different stuffand then in the entire series you willenjoy this language so I hope you willbe watching this series let me know inthe comments section and do clean likebut if you're enjoying it thanks forwatching everyonebuh bye
